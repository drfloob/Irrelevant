# irrelevant

Note: **NOT FUNCTIONAL YET**

Irrelevant is an old-school gamepad emulator for Android phones. It allows you to use your Android phone as a basic input device for computer games.

This is a combination of java server for your computer and an android app. If you're looking for a non-technical solution, this isn't it. 

The keymappings are configurable, and if you can code a bit, you can define your own controllers pretty easily.
