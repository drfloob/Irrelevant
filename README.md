# irrelevant

Irrelevant is an old-school gamepad emulator for Android phones. It allows you to use your Android phone as a basic input device for computer games, and it comes pre-packed with a handful of familiar console controller skins.

The keymappings are configurable, and if you can code a bit, you can define your own controllers!
